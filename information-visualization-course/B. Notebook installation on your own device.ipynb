    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the notebooks on your own machine instead of the cloud you need to install several software packages and python modules. The following needs to be installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.10+\n",
    "- virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "First decide if you want to install it all globally or in a virtual environment (the latter is really recommended to reduce python module clutter in you global python environment). If you want to do install everything in an virtual environment, create a virtual environment first like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv infovisenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`source infovisenv/bin/activate` (on Linux or Mac)\n",
    "\n",
    "`.\\infovisenv\\Scripts\\activate`  (on Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can use pip and the [**requirements.txt**](./requirements.txt) file to install all the needed python modules and dependencies in the virtual environment by simply excuting the following command in your terminal: \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -r ./requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if all the required software and python modules are installed you can use the notebooks by starting a jupyter notebook server by issuing the following command in the directory of the notebooks which can be downloaded from [here](./notebooks.tar.gz).\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "If there any questions you can ask the course instructor for some guidance or mail the question to: [Casper van Leeuwen](mailto:casper.vanleeuwen@surf.nl). "
